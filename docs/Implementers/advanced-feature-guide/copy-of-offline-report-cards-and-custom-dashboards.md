Avni allows you to create different indicator reports that are available offline to the field users. These reports help field users to derive more insights on the captured data.

Creating an offline report is a two-step process. First, we need to create a report card that holds the actual query function. Second, we group multiple cards into to a dashboard.

## Creating a Card

Creating a new card is no different than creating any other Avni entity. Open app designer and go to the **Card** tab. Click on the new card and provide the details like name, description, etc.

### Card Types

Cards can be of 4 types:

1. **Standard Report Card** — Built-in logic for common use cases (scheduled visits, overdue, approvals, etc.)
2. **Custom Data Card** — A query-based card with configurable actions (view subject profile, do visit, or mark attendance)
3. **Nested Report Card** — A single query that renders up to 9 sub-cards
4. **Custom Design Card** — A fully custom card rendered using an uploaded HTML template with dynamic data

### 1. Standard Report Cards

The logic used to display the values in standard cards is already implemented in Avni. The different types are (Entity specified in brackets indicates the type of entity listed on clicking on the card):

- Pending approval (Entity Approval Statuses)

- Approved (Entity Approval Statuses)

- Rejected (Entity Approval Statuses)

- Scheduled visits (Subjects)

- Overdue visits (Subjects)

- Recent registrations (Subjects)

- Recent enrolments (Subjects)

- Recent visits (Subjects)

- Total (Subjects)

- Comments (Subjects)

- Call tasks (Tasks)

- Open subject tasks (Tasks)

- Due checklist (Individuals)

#### Standard Report Card Type Filters

Filters can be added at the report card level for certain standard report types. The following filters are supported:

1. Subject Type
2. Program
3. Encounter Type
4. Recent Duration

Subject Type, Program and Encounter Type filters are supported for 'Overdue Visits', 'Scheduled Visits', 'Total' and 'Recent' types ('Recent registrations', 'Recent enrolments', 'Recent visits').

![](https://files.readme.io/c2f3eb0a468c1e8e3efb808ccb831cf87e19c5da5ba92ae9ed99a0af619d528f-image.png)

<br />

Filters can also be configured at the dashboard level (covered below). If a filter is configured both at the report card level and the dashboard level, the filter at the report card level is applied first. Hence, mixing of the same type of filter at both levels should be avoided as it could lead to the unintuitive behaviour of the field user selecting a value, say 'Household' for the subject type filter at the dashboard level but still seeing the numbers for the 'Individual' subject type which is configured at the report card level.

### 2. Custom Data Cards

Custom data cards are query-based cards where the implementer writes the logic. They support configurable **actions** that determine what happens when a user taps the card on the mobile app.

#### Action Configuration

When creating a custom data card (with "Is Standard Report Card?" disabled), an **Action** dropdown appears with three options:

- **View subject profile** (default) — Opens the subject's profile on tap
- **Do visit** — Opens an encounter form on tap
- **Mark attendance** — Opens the attendance sheet for a class, pre-selected to one attendance type for today (requires the [Attendance](doc:attendance) feature)

#### View Subject Profile (Default Action)

This is the default action. The card runs your query and displays the result on the dashboard tile.

**Behavior:**

- **Multiple subjects returned:** Shows the list of subjects. The custom card name appears in the top bar.
- **Single subject returned:** Directly opens the subject's profile — no listing screen shown.
- **No subjects returned:** Card shows count as 0.

The query can return a simple array of subjects:

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    return params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered("voided == false AND subjectType.name = 'MySubjectType'");
};
```

Or return an object with additional display properties:

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const individuals = [...params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered("voided == false AND subjectType.name = 'MySubjectType'")];
    return {
        primaryValue: individuals.length,
        secondaryValue: '(active)',
        cardColor: '#123456',
        textColor: '#ffffff',
        cardName: 'Dynamic Card Name',
        lineListFunction: () => individuals
    };
};
```

**Query Return Properties:**

| Property           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `primaryValue`     | Yes      | The main value displayed on the card (typically a count or percentage)                                                                                 |
| `secondaryValue`   | No       | Additional text displayed below the primary value                                                                                                      |
| `cardColor`        | No       | Background color of the card tile (hex). Overrides the color set in the admin UI                                                                       |
| `textColor`        | No       | Text color on the card tile (hex). Overrides default                                                                                                   |
| `cardName`         | No       | Display name on the card tile and list header. Overrides the card name set in the admin UI                                                             |
| `lineListFunction` | No       | A function that returns the list of subjects. If provided, the card becomes tappable. If not provided, the card displays the value but is not tappable |

**Backward Compatibility:** All existing custom card queries continue to work. Queries returning a plain array of subjects, or only `primaryValue` and `lineListFunction`, or `primaryValue` without `lineListFunction` (e.g., percentage cards) all work as before.

**Example: Percentage Card (Non-tappable because&#x20;**`lineListFunction`**&#x20;is not a function)**

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const total = params.db.objects('Individual').filtered('voided = false').length;
    const enrolled = params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered("voided = false AND SUBQUERY(enrolments, $e, $e.voided = false AND $e.program.name = 'MyProgram').@count > 0").length;
    const percentage = total > 0 ? ((enrolled / total) * 100).toFixed(1) : 0;
    return {primaryValue: percentage + '%', lineListFunction: 'n/a'};
};
```

#### Do Visit Action

This action is for cards where tapping should directly open an encounter form. When **Do visit** is selected, additional configuration fields appear:

| Field              | Required | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Subject Type**   | Yes      | The subject type this card applies to                                                            |
| **Program**        | No       | The program (for program encounters). Leave empty for general encounters                         |
| **Encounter Type** | Yes      | The encounter form to open                                                                       |
| **Visit Type**     | Yes      | **Scheduled** — opens an existing scheduled visit. **Unplanned** — creates and opens a new visit |

**Scheduled Visit Type:**

- On tap, only subjects with a scheduled encounter of the configured type are shown.
- The encounter type name appears below each subject in the list. Clicking it opens the scheduled visit form directly.
- Single matching subject: opens the form directly — no listing shown.
- No matching subjects: card dismisses without navigation.

**Unplanned Visit Type:**

- On tap, only subjects enrolled in the configured program (if set) are shown.
- The encounter type name appears below each subject. Clicking it opens a new visit form.
- Single matching subject: opens the new form directly — no listing shown.

For Do visit cards, the count shown on the card tile is the filtered count (subjects with eligible encounters), not the `primaryValue` from the query. This ensures the tile always reflects how many subjects the user will actually see on tap.

**Example: Scheduled Program Encounter**

Admin configuration: Action = Do visit, Subject Type = Patient, Program = Maternal Health, Encounter Type = ANC Visit, Visit Type = Scheduled

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const individuals = [...params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered("voided == false AND subjectType.name = 'Patient'")];
    return {
        primaryValue: individuals.length,
        cardName: 'ANC Visits Due',
        cardColor: '#e65100',
        lineListFunction: () => individuals
    };
};
```

**Example: Unplanned General Encounter**

Admin configuration: Action = Do visit, Subject Type = Household, Program = (empty), Encounter Type = Survey, Visit Type = Unplanned

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const individuals = [...params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered("voided == false AND subjectType.name = 'Household'")];
    return {
        primaryValue: individuals.length,
        cardName: 'Surveys to Fill',
        lineListFunction: () => individuals
    };
};
```

#### Mark Attendance Action

This action turns a card into a **daily attendance worklist** for one attendance type. It is built for organisations that run several named attendances a day (for example Morning Prayer / Math Class / Afternoon Reading) across many classes and need a "what's still unmarked today" nudge. Tapping a class on the card jumps the field worker **straight into the attendance sheet for that class and attendance type, for today** — instead of opening the class dashboard — and on save returns them to the card with one fewer class pending.

> **Prerequisite:** the [Attendance](doc:attendance) feature. The chosen Group Subject Type must already have attendance enabled with at least one fully configured attendance type. Configure **one card per attendance type** (a card targets a single attendance type).

When **Mark attendance** is selected, these configuration fields appear:

| Field                    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Group Subject Type**   | Yes      | Only Group subject types that have attendance enabled are listed                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Attendance Type**      | Yes      | The attendance types configured on the chosen Group Subject Type. Changing the Group Subject Type resets this picker. If the subject type has none, a hint points you to _App Designer → Subject Types → Attendance_ |
| **On Action Completion** | Yes      | **Source Page** (default) — after saving, return to the card list (count decremented). **Subject Profile Page** — after saving, land on the class dashboard                                                          |

{/* upload `mark-attendance-card-config.png` — App Designer Custom Data Card editor with Action = "Mark attendance" selected, showing the Group Subject Type picker (set to "Class"), the cascading Attendance Type picker (set to "Morning Prayer"), and On Action Completion = "Source Page" */}

**Behaviour on the field app (Android):**

- The card tile reads e.g. **"Morning Prayer — 4 pending"**. The count and the listed classes come entirely from the card's **query** (see the sample below) evaluated on-device — the server computes nothing.
- Tapping the card opens the usual subject listing of the classes the query returned.
- Tapping a class opens the **attendance sheet pre-selected to that attendance type for today** — the same roster, inline absence-reason and save sheet as the per-class flow. The date strip stays available, so a past date can still be corrected from there.
- On save, **On Action Completion** decides where the worker lands — back on the card list (one fewer pending) or on the class dashboard.

<Image src="https://files.readme.io/0a1a995cee00efaaf2e44eb580a89be8ce3de5efabcd54ddf72e9f39134948b2-Screenshot-2026-06-02-at-25653PM_1.jpg" alt="Android custom dashboard with a Mark attendance card reading Morning Prayer — 4 pending, which deep-links into the attendance sheet for the chosen class" align="center" width="720px" />


> **Platform note:** the deep-link is **Android only** for now. A Mark-attendance card still renders on the webapp's Data Entry App dashboards and lists the classes, but a row tap there opens the subject dashboard (today's behaviour) rather than the attendance sheet.

**Sample "unmarked today" query.** Use this as a starting point and adapt the filters to your organisation. It returns the classes that are still missing this attendance type's session for today; the card count is the length of that list. The query does **not** receive the card's configured Group Subject Type / Attendance Type — set them yourself at the top of the query (by UUID below, or resolve them by name). Since each card targets one attendance type, give each card its own copy with the right values.

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const db = params.db;
    const moment = imports.moment;

    // Session.scheduledDate is stored as a calendar-date string ("YYYY-MM-DD"),
    // so compare against today's date as a string, not a JS Date.
    const todayStr = moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD');

    // Set these to match this card's Group Subject Type and Attendance Type
    // (the query has no access to the card config). Use UUIDs, or resolve by name.
    const subjectTypeUUID    = "<your-group-subject-type-uuid>";
    const attendanceTypeUUID = "<your-attendance-type-uuid>";

    // 1. Classes of the configured Group Subject Type in the user's catchment.
    const classes = [...db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered("voided == false AND subjectType.uuid == $0", subjectTypeUUID)];

    // 2. Keep only classes that do NOT yet have a (non-voided) Session for
    //    (this class, today, this attendance type).
    const unmarked = classes.filter((cls) => {
        const session = db.objects('Session').filtered(
            "voided == false AND scheduledDate == $0 AND attendanceTypeUUID == $1 AND groupSubjectUUID == $2",
            todayStr, attendanceTypeUUID, cls.uuid
        );
        return session.length === 0;
    });

    // Optional: also drop classes whose resolved calendar makes today a
    //           non-working day, so the worklist only shows expected sessions.

    return {
        primaryValue: unmarked.length,
        secondaryValue: 'pending',
        lineListFunction: () => unmarked
    };
};
```

### 3. Custom Design Cards

Custom design cards allow implementers to upload an HTML file as the display template for a fully custom card. This enables org-specific layouts (tables, styling, sections) without being constrained by the fixed Avni card UI.

**Configuration:**

1. Select **Custom Design Card** as the card type
2. **Data Rule** (optional): A JS rule that returns dynamic data for the HTML template. Input/output follows the same pattern as other card rules — dashboard filters are passed as input, and the rule returns data accessible in the HTML via `data.variableName`. If `primaryValue`/`secondaryValue` are returned, they show on the card tile. If `cardName`/`cardColor`/`textColor` are returned, they override defaults.
3. **HTML File** (required): Upload an HTML file defining the custom layout. Saving without an HTML file shows a validation error. Saving without a data rule is allowed.

Sample Data Rule and HTML

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const _ = imports.lodash;
    const moment = imports.moment;

    const startOfMonth = moment().startOf('month').toDate();

    const subjects = params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered('voided = false ');

    const rows = _.map(subjects, ind => {
        const enrolment = _.first(ind.enrolments);
        const lastEncounter = enrolment
            ? _.maxBy(enrolment.encounters, e => e.encounterDateTime)
            : _.maxBy(ind.encounters, e => e.encounterDateTime);
        return {
            date: moment(ind.registrationDate).format('DD.MM.YY'),
            name: ind.name,
            status: 'approved',
            village: ind.lowestAddressLevel ? ind.lowestAddressLevel.name : null,
            program: enrolment ? enrolment.program.name : null,
            lastVisit: lastEncounter && lastEncounter.encounterDateTime
                ? moment(lastEncounter.encounterDateTime).format('DD.MM.YY')
                : null,
            amount: null,
        };
    });

    return {
        primaryValue: rows.length,
        secondaryValue: `(${rows.length} this month)`,
        name: 'Recent Registrations',
        colors: { background: '#FFE500', text: '#222222' },

        lineListFunction: () => ({
            total: rows.length,
            rows: rows,
        }),
    };
}

In the mobile app, the HTML template is rendered with data from the rule. The HTML is wrapped as a template literal and data is passed to generate the final HTML string, rendered within a `WebView`.

## Creating a Dashboard

After all the cards are done it's time to group them together using the dashboard. Offline Dashboards have the following sub-components:

- Sections : Visual Partitions used to club together cards of specific grouping type
- Offline (Custom) Report Cards : Usually Clickable blocks with count information about grouping of Individuals or EntityApprovals of specific type
- Filters : Configurable filters that get applied to all "Report Cards" count and listing

Users with access to the "App Designer" can Create, Modifiy or Delete Custom Dashboards as seen below.

![](https://files.readme.io/824878a-image.png)

### Steps to configure a Custom Dashboard

- Click on the dashboard tab on the app designer and click on the new dashboard.
- This will take you to the new dashboard screen. Provide the name and description of the dashboard.
- You can create sections on this screen and
- Select all the cards you need to add to the section in the dashboard.
- After adding all the cards, you can re-arrange the cards in the order you want them to see in the field app.


<Image src="https://files.readme.io/b6a8b74-Screenshot_2023-12-11_at_4.45.34_PM.png" align="center" />


### Dashboard Filters

You can also create filters for a dashboard on the same screen by clicking on "Add Filter". This shows a popup as in the below screenshot where you can configure your filter and set the filter name, type, widget type and other values based on your filter type.

![](https://files.readme.io/91f1aa1-image.png)

Once all the changes are done. Save the dashboard.

#### For the filters to be applied to the cards in the dashboard, the code for the cards will need to handle the filters.

Sample Code for handling filters in report card:

```
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
//console.log('------>',params.ruleInput.filter( type => type.Name === "Gender" ));
//console.log("params:::", JSON.stringify(params.ruleInput));
  let individualList = params.db.objects('Individual').filtered("voided = false and subjectType.name = 'Individual'" )
     .filter( (individual) => individual.getAgeInYears() >= 18 && individual.getAgeInYears() <= 49  &&  individual.getObservationReadableValue('Is sterilisation done') === 'No');
  
  if (params.ruleInput) {

       let genderFilter = params.ruleInput.filter(rule => rule.type === "Gender");
       let genderValue = genderFilter[0].filterValue[0].name;
      
        console.log('genderFilter---------',genderFilter);
        console.log('genderValue---------',genderValue);        
        
      return individualList
     .filter( (individual) => {
     console.log("individual.gender:::", JSON.stringify(individual.gender.name));
     return individual.gender.name === genderValue;
     });
     }
     else return individualList;
};
```

### Assigning custom Dashboards to User Groups

Custom Dashboards created need to be assigned specifically to a User Group, in-order for Users to see it on the Avni-client mobile app. You may do this, by navigating to the "Admin" app -> "User Groups" -> (User\_GROUP) -> "Dashboards" tab, and assigning one or more Custom Dashboards to a User-Group.

In addition, You can also mark one of these Custom Dashboards as the Primary (Is Primary: True) dashboard from the "Admin" app -> "User Groups" -> (User\_GROUP) -> "Dashboards".


<Image src="https://files.readme.io/54b6434-Screenshot_2024-06-26_at_12.14.37_PM.png" align="center" />


## Using the Dashboard in the Field App

After saving the dashboard sync the field app, and from the bottom "More" tab click on the "Dashboards" option. It will take you to the dashboard screen and will show all the cards that are added to the dashboard.


<Image src="https://files.readme.io/8b37cf6-Screenshot_2024-06-26_at_12.15.37_PM.png" alt="Report cards only passing List of subjects." align="center" width="400px" caption="Report cards only passing List of subjects." />



<Image src="https://files.readme.io/548f99d-offline-dashboard.png" alt="566" align="center" width="400px" caption="Report cards  returning `primaryValue` and `secondaryValue` object" />


Clicking any card will take the user to the subject listing page, which will display all the subject names returned by the card query. For custom data cards with the "View subject profile" action, if only one subject is returned, the app directly opens the subject's profile. For cards with the "Do visit" action, clicking opens the encounter form directly (for single subject) or shows the list with encounter type rows below each subject. For cards with the "Mark attendance" action, tapping a class opens the attendance sheet for that class and attendance type for today (Android only — see the _Mark Attendance Action_ section above).

Multiple subjects registered and View Subject Profile action configured

Users can click on any subject and navigate to their dashboard.

## Secondary Dashboard

### Web app configuration

As part of Avni release 8.0.0, a new feature of a secondary dashboard is added which can be configured at user group level to populate an additional option on the Avni mobile app bottom drawer to navigate to a secondary dashboard. This configuration has to be done in the user group in Avni web app.

- By navigating to the dashboard section in a particular user group where dashboards can be added to user groups, the secondary dashboard can be defined apart from the home dashboard. As shown in the screenshot below, any dashboard can be selected as the secondary dashboard.


<Image src="https://files.readme.io/68ac5d9-Screenshot_2024-06-26_at_12.14.37_PM.png" align="center" width="1500px" />



<Image src="https://files.readme.io/a5640e1-Se.png" align="center" width="15px" />


### Secondary dashboard in mobile app

The configuration mentioned above would display the particular dashboard in the mobile app as given below. This would allow users to access the home and secondary dashboard from the bottom drawer of the mobile app instead of navigating to the more page.


<Image src="https://files.readme.io/d95166d-Screenshot_2024-06-26_at_12.17.40_PM.png" align="center" width="400px" />


### Clash in Dashboards configuration across different UserGroups

In-case a User belongs to multiple UserGroups, where-in each has a different Primary and/or Secondary Dashboards, then the behaviour is undeterministic. I.e, any of the possible Primary Dashboards across the various UserGroups, would show up as the Primary on the app. Similar behaviour should be expected of the Secondary Dashboard as well.

## Report card query examples

Report cards written for the new database follow a different pattern. See [Writing report cards that work on the new database](/docs/writing-rules#writing-report-cards-that-work-on-the-new-database-technical) in the rules guide.


As mentioned earlier, a query can return a list of Individuals or an object with properties:

```javascript
{
    primaryValue: '20',
    secondaryValue: '(5%)',
    cardColor: '#123456',    // overrides card background color
    textColor: '#ffffff',    // overrides card text color
    cardName: 'Dynamic Name', // overrides card name on tile and list header
    lineListFunction: () => [...] // returns list of subjects; makes card tappable
}
```

`primaryValue` is the main display value. `lineListFunction` should return the list of subjects — if not provided or not a function, the card displays the value but is not tappable. `cardColor`, `textColor`, and `cardName` are optional and override the static values configured in the admin UI.

DB instance is passed using the params and useful libraries like lodash and moment are available in the imports parameter of the function. Below are some examples of writing the `lineListFunction`.

The below function returns a list of pregnant women having any high-risk conditions.

```javascript High risk condition women
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const isHighRiskWomen = (enrolment) => {
        const weight = enrolment.findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment('Weight');
        const hb = enrolment.findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment('Hb');
        const numberOfLiveChildren = enrolment.findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment('Number of live children');
        return (weight && weight.getReadableValue() < 40) || (hb && hb.getReadableValue() < 8) ||
            (numberOfLiveChildren && numberOfLiveChildren.getReadableValue() > 3)
    };
    return {
      lineListFunction: () => params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered(`SUBQUERY(enrolments, $enrolment, SUBQUERY($enrolment.encounters, $encounter, $encounter.encounterType.name = 'Monthly monitoring of pregnant woman' and $encounter.voided = false).@count > 0 and $enrolment.voided = false and voided = false).@count > 0`)
        .filter((individual) => individual.voided === false && _.some(individual.enrolments, (enrolment) => enrolment.program.name === 'Pregnant Woman' && isHighRiskWomen(enrolment)))
    }
};
```

It is important to write optimised query and load very less data in memory for processing. There will be the cases where query can't be written in realm and we need to load the data in memory, but remember more data we load into the memory slower will be the reports. As an example consider below two cases, in the first case we directly query realm to fetch all the individuals enrolled in Child program, but in the second case we first load all individuals into memory and then filter those cases.

```javascript Query in Realm context (better performance)
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => ({
    lineListFunction: () => params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered(`SUBQUERY(enrolments, $enrolment, $enrolment.program.name = 'Child' and voided = false).@count > 0`)
});
```
```javascript Query in app context (poor performance)
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    return params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filter((individual) => individual.voided === false && _.some(individual.enrolments, (enrolment) => enrolment.program.name === 'Child'))
};
```

For using the filters in the rules also check section on Dashboard Card Rule here - [Writing rules](doc:writing-rules)

## Performance of queries

The report cards requires one to return a list individuals. This can be done by:

1. Performing db.objects on Individual and filtering them down.
2. Performing db.objects on descendants of Subject (like encounter, enrolment), filter them down, then return list of Individuals from each filtered object. Example is given below.

## Implementation Patterns for writing performant queries

Please refer to [this reference for Realm Query Language](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/device-sdks/realm-query-language/).

To understand difference between filter and filtered that is referred below, please see, [https://avni.readme.io/docs/writing-rules#difference-between-filter-and-filtered](https://avni.readme.io/docs/writing-rules#difference-between-filter-and-filtered)

Please also get in touch with platform team if you identify a new pattern and a new type of requirement where none of the following fits.

1. Filter based on chronological data
   1. The matching has to be done on specific chronological descendant entity. e.g. `first` encounter of a specific type, `recent` encounter of specific type.
   2. In this case performing `db.objects` on Individual will lead to either very complex queries or will demand performing filtering in memory using JS.
   3. In this case one can do `db.objects` on descendant entity and then use something like `.filtered('TRUEPREDICATE sort(programEnrolment.individual.uuid asc , encounterDateTime desc) Distinct(programEnrolment.individual.uuid)')` to get the chronological relevant entity at the top in each group. Distinct keyword picks only the first entity in the sorted group.
   4. After performing `filtered`, one can return Subjects by performing `list.map(enc => enc.programEnrolment.individual)`
2. Filter based exact observation value
   1. Matching observations by loading them in memory and calling JS functions will lead to slower reports.
   2. A combination of `subquery` and realm query based match will have much better performance. For example: matching observation that has a specific value - `SUBQUERY(observations, $observation, $observation.concept.name = 'Phone number' and $observation.valueJSON CONTAINS '7555795537'`
3. Filter based on exact specific coded observation value
   1. Matching coded value using its name will require one to load data in memory and perform the match. But this could result in sub-optimal performance. Hence the readability of the report should be sacrificed here for performance.
   2. The query will be like `SUBQUERY(observations, $observation, $observation.concept.uuid = 'Marital Status' and $observation.valueJSON CONTAINS 'fb1080b4-d1ec-4c87-a10d-3838ba9abc5b'`
   3. Please note here that multiple observations can be matched here using OR, AND etc.
4. Filter based on a custom observation value expression.
   1. Instead of matching against a single value match using numeric expression. e.g. match BMI greater than 20.0.
   2. This kind of match cannot be done using realm query and implementing them in JS may result in poor performance.
   3. In such cases we should find out the significance of magic number 20.0. Usually we also have a coded decision observation associated that has meaning behind 20.0, like malnutrition status, BMI Status etc. If there is one then we should match against that using pattern 3 above. If such observation is not present then consider adding them to decisions.
   4. In requirements where such associated coded observation are not present and cannot be added, the performance will depend on the number of observations and entities being matched. If this number is large the performance is expected to be slow, it is better to avoid making reports, or move such reports to their own dashboard - so that they don't impact the usability of other reports.

### Detailed examples

#### DEPRECATED: Avoid using generic functions:

- The following is deprecated cause we should use `Filter based on chronological data` pattern from above.
- To find observation of a concept avoid using the function `findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment` unless absolutely necessary since it searches for the observation in all encounters and enrolment observations. Use specific functions.
- Eg: To find observation in enrolment can use the function `enrolment.findObservation` or to find observations in specific encounter type can get the encounters using `enrolment.lastFulfilledEncounter(...encounterTypeNames)` and then find observation. Refer code examples for the below 3 usecases.

#### Based on the use case decide whether to write the logic using realm query or JS.

- Not always achieving the purpose using realm queries might be efficient/possible.

  - **DEPRECATED** cause we should use `Filter based on chronological data` pattern from above. Eg: consider a use case where a mandatory concept is used in a program encounter. Now to check the latest value of the concept, its sufficient to check the last encounter and need not iterate all encounters. Since realm subquery doesn't support searching only in the last encounter, for such usecases, using realm queries not only becomes slow and also sometimes inappropriate depending on the usecase. So in such cases, using JS code for the logic, is more efficient. (refer the below code example)

    - ```Text Usecase
      ```

    Find dead children using concept value captured in encounter cancel or program exit form.

  - Please also refer to `Filter based on a custom observation value expression` pattern above, before using this. Consider another use case, where observations of numeric concepts need to be compared. This is not possible to achieve via realm query since the solution would involve the need for JSON parsing of the stored observation. Hence JS logic is appropriate here. (refer below code example)

### 3. Nested Report Cards

Frequently there are cases where across report cards very similar logic is used and only a value used for comparison, changes. Eg: in one of our partner organisations, we load 'Total SAM children' and 'Total MAM children'. For rendering each takes around 20-30s. And hence the dashboard nos doesn't load until both the report card results are calculated and it makes the user to wait for a minute. If the logic is combined, we can render the results in 30s since it would need only retrieval from db and iterating once.<br />The above kind of scenarios also lead to code duplication across report cards and when some requirement changes, then the change needs to be done in both.

In-order to handle such scenarios, we recommend using the Nested Report Card. This is a non-standard report card, which has the ability to show upto a maximum of **9** report cards, based on a single Query's response.

The query can return an object with "reportCards" property, which holds within it an array of objets with properties, ` { cardName: 'nested-i', cardColor: '#123456', textColor: '#654321', primaryValue: '20', secondaryValue: '(5%)',  lineListFunction: () => \{/\*Do something\\\\\\\*/} }`. DB instance is passed using the params and useful libraries like lodash and moment are available in the imports parameter of the function.

<br />

    /*

### 4. Custom Design Cards

Custom design cards let you define both the data and the UI for a dashboard card. You provide an HTML template and a data rule; the platform evaluates the rule, passes the result into your template, and renders it in a WebView on the mobile app.

#### How it works

1. **Data rule** — a JavaScript function that queries the device database and returns data
2. **HTML template** — an HTML file that renders the data using `${data.variable}` syntax
3. **Platform glue** — the platform calls your data rule, takes the return value of `lineListFunction()`, and passes it as `data` to your HTML template

<br />

```
Data rule returns:
{
    primaryValue: 10,          ← shown on dashboard tile
    secondaryValue: "(5 new)", ← shown below primaryValue on tile
    cardName: "My Card",       ← overrides tile name (optional)
    cardColor: "#FFE500",      ← overrides tile background (optional)
    textColor: "#222",         ← overrides tile text color (optional)
    lineListFunction: () => {  ← called by platform, result becomes 'data' in HTML
        return {
            total: 10,
            rows: [...]
        };
    }
}

HTML template receives:
    data.total  → 10
    data.rows   → [...]
```

#### Configuration

1. Select **Custom Design Card** as the card type
2. **Data Rule** (optional): A JS rule that returns dynamic data for the HTML template. Input/output follows the same pattern as other card rules — `params.db` provides access to the Realm database, and dashboard filters are available via `params.ruleInput`. If `primaryValue`/`secondaryValue` are returned, they show on the card tile. If `cardName`/`cardColor`/`textColor` are returned, they override defaults. `lineListFunction` should be a function — the platform calls it and passes the return value as `data` to the HTML template. Saving without a data rule is allowed (the HTML renders with an empty `data` object).
3. **HTML File** (required): Upload an HTML file defining the custom layout. Saving without an HTML file shows a validation error.



   #### HTML Template Syntax

   The HTML file is evaluated as a JavaScript **template literal**. Everything inside `${...}` is executed as JavaScript with `data` in scope.



   ```html
   <!-- Simple value -->
   <div>${data.total}</div>

   <!-- Loop -->
   ${data.rows.map(row => `<tr><td>${row.name}</td></tr>`).join('')}

   <!-- Conditional -->
   ${data.rows.length > 0 ? `<table>...</table>` : `<div>No data</div>`}
   ```

   #### Interactive Filtering

   For interactivity (dropdowns, filters), embed the data as JSON in a `<script>` tag and use plain JavaScript:

   ```html
   <select id="month-filter" onchange="filterByMonth()">
       <option value="all">All months</option>
   </select>
   <tbody id="table-body"></tbody>

   <script>
       var allRows = ${JSON.stringify(data.rows)};

       function filterByMonth() {
           var selected = document.getElementById('month-filter').value;
           var filtered = selected === 'all'
               ? allRows
               : allRows.filter(function(row) { return row.month === selected; });
           renderRows(filtered);
       }

       function renderRows(rows) {
           document.getElementById('table-body').innerHTML = rows.map(function(row) {
               return '<tr><td>' + row.name + '</td></tr>';
           }).join('');
       }

       renderRows(allRows);
   </script>
   ```

   The key pattern: `${JSON.stringify(data.rows)}` injects the data as a JSON literal at template evaluation time. The `<script>` then uses it as a regular JavaScript variable for dynamic filtering.

   #### Scrolling

   **Vertical scrolling** is handled by the platform automatically. **Horizontal scrolling** is the implementer's responsibility — wrap wide tables in a container with `overflow-x: auto`:

<br />

```html
<div style="overflow-x: auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;">
    <table><!-- wide table --></table>
</div>
```

#### Things to Avoid

- **Backticks** — the HTML is wrapped in backticks. A stray \`\`\` in your HTML will break evaluation. Use `&#96;` for backtick characters.
- **Template expressions in scripts** — inside `<script>` tags, use string concatenation instead of backtick template literals to avoid ambiguity with the outer template evaluation.
- **Heavy computations in lineListFunction** — it's called every time the card detail view opens. Keep it fast with indexed Realm queries.

#### Complete Example

**Data rule:**

```javascript
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => \{
    const _ = imports.lodash;
    const moment = imports.moment;
    const startOfMonth = moment().startOf('month').toDate();

    const subjects = params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered('voided = false AND registrationDate >= $0', startOfMonth);

    const rows = _.map(subjects, ind => ({
        date: moment(ind.registrationDate).format('DD.MM.YY'),
        name: ind.name,
        status: 'approved',
    }));

    return {
        primaryValue: rows.length,
        secondaryValue: `(${rows.length} this month)`,
        cardName: 'Recent Registrations',
        cardColor: '#FFE500',
        textColor: '#222222',
        lineListFunction: () => ({ total: rows.length, rows: rows }),
    };
\}
```

**HTML template:**

```html
<style>
    body { font-family: sans-serif; background: #f5f5f5; }
    .summary { background: white; border: 2px solid #333; border-radius: 6px; padding: 14px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 12px; }
    .summary .value { font-size: 22px; font-weight: 700; }
    table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; border: 2px solid #333; background: white; }
    th { background: #fff3cd; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #333; font-size: 13px; text-align: left; }
    td { padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #333; font-size: 13px; }
</style>

<div class="summary">
    <div class="value">${data.total} registrations this month</div>
</div>

${data.rows.length > 0 ? `
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Name</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
        ${data.rows.map(row => `
        <tr><td>${row.date}</td><td>${row.name}</td><td>${row.status}</td></tr>
        `).join('')}
    </tbody>
</table>

` : `<div style="text-align:center;color:#777;padding:20px;">No registrations this month</div>`}
```

### Bundle Upload

Card configuration — including action settings (action type, subject type, program, encounter type, visit type, and the Mark-attendance action's attendance type) and custom design card HTML — is included in the organisation bundle export/import. All card settings are preserved across bundle upload. No additional configuration is needed after import.

## Default Dashboard and Cards

Starting in release 10.0, any newly created organisation will have a default dashboard created with the following sections, standard cards and filters.

Default Dashboard (Filters: 'Subject Type' and 'As On Date')

1. Visit Details Section

   2. Recent Enrolments Card (Recent duration filter configured as - 1 day)
   3. Recent Visits Card (Recent duration filter configured as - 1 day)
3. Registration Overview Section
